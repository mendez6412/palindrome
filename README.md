#palindrome

This is my TIY W1D3 Homework (focusing on recursion and string mutation).

##Normal Mode:

###palindrome.py
	FUNCTION:
	- Test user input (string) for palindrome
	NOTES:
	- Uses recursion to test for palindrome
	- For use with palindrome_test.py
	- I've included the other difficulties in this file, but they are commented out
	
###palindrome_test.py
	FUNCTION:
	- Provide tests for palindrome.py

##Advanced Mode: 

###adv_palindrome.py
	FUNCTION:
	- Test user input (string) for palindrome
	NOTES:
	- Simplest solution to testing for palindrome

###loopy_palindrome.py
	FUNCTION:
	- Test user input (string) for palindrome
	NOTES:
	- Uses loops to test for palindrome
	
##Epic Mode:

###is_file_palindrome.py
	FUNCTION: 
	- Test file input for palindromes by line
	- Also test if entire file (read as a unit) is a palindrome
	- call $ python3 is_file_palindrome.py file_name.txt
	NOTES:
	- I'd like to improve the readability of the outputs

###Demetri_Martin.txt
	NOTES:
	- Martin's famous 224-word palindrome for testing
